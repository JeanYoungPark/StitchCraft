 Keep these instructions in mind: 
  When you see Red Box with stack trace, you can click any 
  stack frame to jump to the source file. The packager will launch your 
  editor of choice. It will first look at REACT_EDITOR environment 
  variable, then at EDITOR.
  To set it up, you can add something like 
  export REACT_EDITOR=atom to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc depending on 
  which shell you use.

 ERROR  Error: [@RNC/AsyncStorage]: NativeModule: AsyncStorage is null.

To fix this issue try these steps:

  • Uninstall, rebuild and restart the app.

  • Run the packager with `--reset-cache` flag.

  • If you are using CocoaPods on iOS, run `pod install` in the `ios` directory, then rebuild and re-run the app.

  • Make sure your project's `package.json` depends on `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, even if you only depend on it indirectly through other dependencies. CLI only autolinks native modules found in your `package.json`.

  • If this happens while testing with Jest, check out how to integrate AsyncStorage here: https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/advanced/jest

If none of these fix the issue, please open an issue on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage/issues
